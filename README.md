# Intro - HTML and CSS

A basic example of HTML and CSS.
 
### This project illustrates the following technologies:

* **Source Code Management (SCM)**
    * Source code management enables coordination, sharing and collaboration for individuals that are developing software. 
    * It provides users with the ability to share code and track changes as well as review, comment, and improve each otherâ€™s code.
    * [git](https://git-scm.com) enables individuals to work from their local copy of the code and then make it available for others to access and use. 
    * For this project you will be using your personal [github.com](http://github.com) account to access
* **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**
    * HTML provides a logical way to structure web page content.
    * It defines the structure and presentation of raw text by surrounding it with information computers can interpret.
    * HyperText is displayed on your browser and can link to other HyperText via HyperLinks.
    * It is not used to style your page content.

* **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
    * CSS is used to describe the presentation of a document. 
    * It describes how elements should be rendered, meaning how they are styled.
    * CSS uses rule-sets to select HTML elements and declarations to alter their presentation.

* An IDE ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) preferred)
  - **IDE** stands for [<ins>I</ins>ntegrated <ins>D</ins>evelopment <ins>E</ins>nvironment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) 
  which is a software application that provides tools for computer programmers for software development. 
  An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
